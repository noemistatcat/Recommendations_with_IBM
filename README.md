## Description

The goal for this project is to come up with article recommendations for IBM Watson Studio platform. It uses real data from the platform, and employs three strategies in coming up with recommendations:
1. Rank-Based Recommendations
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Matrix Factorization

This project is in partial fulfillment of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course requirements.
